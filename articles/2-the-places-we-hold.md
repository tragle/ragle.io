# Who has no visited a place like this

I remember being on the street and feeling an enormous sense of relief that I had escaped from the house.
- Dr. Christine Blasey Ford

Last night, on the edge of sleep, when the mind begins to ignore the sounds of the room and turn its attention to the rising dream-state within, in that fleeting, oft-forgotten time flickering like a candle from waking to hallucination, I saw a place. I remember a steep hill there, in a city with cobblestones and old architecture, and a building at the top of the hill, with a stone fountain. The building seemed Mediterranean in style, maybe Italian, its stonework solid but also gently curving, and next to this building, in this place, I felt a sense of deep calm in the air, air which seemed to blow with ease from an unseen sea. Then I woke.

As far as I know, I have never visited this place in my waking life. But I have no doubt that somewhere in the world a place like this exists, in fact probably many places like this exist, such that if I found myself in any one of them I might even recall last night's half-dream and wonder how it seemed to prophesy my presence there. And though my dream-memory of this place feels specific, when I examine it closely, it lacks the kind of granular detail which the solid, waking world will readily fill in -- in Italy, or Portugal, or Mexico -- any location having the required steep hill, cobblestoned street, sea breeze, and the rest. 

I have seen other places like this, in dreams and dreamlike states, often recognizable from memories. They form a kind of rotating backdrop, like set-pieces for the unconscious stage, more or less faithfully depicting significant historical sites of my particular personal drama, but eerily empty, barren of players. Not every dream contains such a backdrop -- some have no particular setting at all -- but when they do, the emotional intensity of the experience imbues that place with a mysterious meaning, a realer-than-real quality that stays with me long after I awaken. 

Who has not visited a place like this in sleep or near-sleep? I believe we all hold places like this inside of us, some representing indelible memories, some unrecognizable in their specifics but still clearly amalgalms of our experiences. For instance, though I don't remember a place exactly like the building on the Mediterranean hill, I do remember similar stonework, and a similar feeling, at another place. 

As a teenager, I lived for a couple of years near Maastricht, in The Netherlands. I still have strong memories of these formative years, and in my dreams will sometimes find myself wandering on the old limestone bridge in the Centrum of Maastricht, as I did as a moody 15 year-old in 1987, watching the river flow beneath the bridge's arches, ephemeral currents of time in an older, more solid, more eternal world. And elements of the building on the hill -- the stonework, the old world-ness -- recall this bridge. They seem connected, equally realer-than-real.

In the Maastricht of my dreams, I see, or more accurately sense, throngs of indistinct people milling about. I do not interact with them, and I can't tell, or don't care, whether they can see me. But if they could, I wonder if the sight of me would frighten them, like a ghost. I feel like a being on a different level of consciousness in their midst, as if my spirit walked that bridge in a perpetual 1987. I see their brightly colored jackets, I hear their low, murmuring voices. 

Who has not visited a place like this? 

I moved a lot as a child. My grandparents' house offered a constancy and security which I lacked elsewhere, and even now this house remains, in my mind, a spiritual and physical home base, the ground of my earliest memories. My dreams have often played out in this setting, within the house and the acre or so of land surrounding it. Growing up, I felt a love, peace, and wonder there that I cannot describe. 

The house, a converted Methodist church, stands on a hill overlooking miles of rolling North Texas pasture, with rusty barbed-wire fences on two sides of the property, an old grey barn in the corner, a cinder-block well house next to a pair of long clotheslines, and a covered wooden porch from which one can whistle to the birds in the gnarly oak trees nearby. Or at least it did. The ranch surrounding the property -- and my grandfather's one-time employer -- sold its land to real estate developers, and the pastures have quickly sprouted housing developments, streets, and shops. My grandmother, who moved out of the house several years ago, told me about plans to build a gas station on the site of the house. I don't know if the house still stands today. But it must go. The cars and pickup trucks of the new suburban landscape require frequent refuelings. 

When I visit in my dreams, I see only the house, with open prairie all around. And as I carry this unchanging place with me through the years and stages of my life, conversely, I think, part of me remains here, even as newcomers overlay the landscape with their own memories (and just as I, a newcomer, have wandered dry creek beds once remembered by Comanche children). Once, an ocean covered these pastures, and the primitive sea creatures who scuttled along the ocean floor now rest in naked piles under the sun, their flesh long turned to stone. My days constitute a thin layer on this landscape but I, too, will remain.
